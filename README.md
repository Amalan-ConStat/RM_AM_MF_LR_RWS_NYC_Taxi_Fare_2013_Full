NYC_Taxi_Fare_2013_Full Rproject is a simulation framework to implement the newly introduced model robust approach for the OSMAC sub-sampling method over the NYC Taxi Fare Data for the logistic regression model.

The main effects model includes two variables and rest of the models include every possible combination of the covariates squared term including the intercept.
